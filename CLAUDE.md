- Always read Python rules and user CLAUDE.md. First thing you do.
- Always include in your plan as a reminder to read the files mentioned previously.
- Remember the rules of user CLAUDE.md about new features and proper use of git.

- Never add imports separately from their usage. Always add imports in the same edit as the code that uses them.
- A ruff linter runs after every file edit and will remove unused imports.
